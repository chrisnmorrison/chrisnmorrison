# 👋 Hi, I’m Chris Morrison

🧑‍💻 Full‑stack developer passionate about technology, life, and continuous growth.

## 🏢 My Top Professional Experience

- I have **several years of full-stack development** experience, crafting robust applications with Django, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, .NET, Power Platform, and more. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring frameworks like Next.js, React, and Astro through hobby projects. I've experimented with dozens of stacks just for fun.  
- I spent nearly two years as a **Database Administrator**, maintaining large-scale enterprise databases that supported both critical applications and big data analytics.  
- Prior to tech, I worked for close to five years as a **Behavioural Counsellor**, a unique role blending mental health support and youth work. This experience gave me a deeply people-centered perspective that I use to bring a unique perspective to product design, development, and team dynamics.  
- I also volunteered for three years on a **mental health crisis hotline**, which I consider my "life experience", one of the most challenging yet rewarding and transformative periods of my life.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- A browser extension that replaces the "New tab" page with a custom RSS feed aggregator that supports nonprofits through unobtrusive ads.  
- A full-stack web app that leverages machine learning to improve language learning through sentence mining and context-aware methods. Built with Next.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL, it uses TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and spaCy for features like translation difficulty prediction and intelligent phrase extraction.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Diving deep into machine learning tools like TensorFlow, spaCy, and scikit-learn, with a strong focus on mastering theory and mathematical foundations.  
- Enhancing my skills in scalable architecture and secure software development to create resilient, maintainable systems. I’m also focusing on broader engineering practices including performance optimization, cybersecurity, and cross-functional collaboration.

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Meaningful projects that prioritize people and impact over profit.
