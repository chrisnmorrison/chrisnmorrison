# 👋 Hi, I’m Chris Morrison

🧑‍💻 Full-stack developer passionate about tech, life, and constant learning.

## 🏢 My Top Professional Experience

- Several years building apps with Django, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, .NET, Power Platform, and more. I also tinker with Next.js, React, and Astro in my free time.  
- Around two years as a Database Administrator managing enterprise databases for apps and analytics.  
- Almost five years as a Behavioural Counsellor, blending mental health support with youth work, a perspective I bring to product design and teamwork.  
- Volunteered three years on a mental health crisis hotline, one of the most challenging and rewarding chapters of my life.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- A browser extension that replaces the "New tab" with a nonprofit-supporting RSS feed aggregator.  
- A full-stack ML-powered French learning app using Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and spaCy.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Deepening my understanding of machine learning theory and tools like TensorFlow and spaCy.  
- Improving advanced developer skills like scalable architecture, secure coding, performance, cybersecurity, and cross-team collaboration.

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Projects that make a real impact and put people first.
